## Using FCM as a UnifiedPush provider

This distributor is built-in to the FCM added versions of the UnifiedPush libraries.

FCM needs a reverse proxy to work as a UnifiedPush distributor. This rewrite proxy will need to be hosted by someone who has access to the Firebase secret key.

### Nginx
The additional rule is as follow:
```
location /FCM {
    access_by_lua_block{
        ngx.req.read_body()
        local args = ngx.req.get_uri_args()
        local token = args["token"]
        local req = ngx.req.get_body_data()
        local newreq, n, err = ngx.re.gsub(req, '\\\\', '\\\\')
        local newreq, n, err = ngx.re.gsub(newreq, '"', '\\"')
        local newreq, n, err = ngx.re.gsub(newreq, "^", "{\"to\":\"" .. token .. "\",\"data\":{\"body\":\"")
        local newreq, n, err = ngx.re.gsub(newreq, "$", "\"}}")
        ngx.req.set_body_data(newreq)
    }
    proxy_set_header		Authorization key=<SERVER_KEY>;
    proxy_set_header		Content-Type application/json;
    proxy_pass			https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send;
    proxy_set_header            Host fcm.googleapis.com;

    # Force https
    if ($scheme = http) {
        rewrite ^ https://$server_name$request_uri? permanent;
    }
}
```

### Go

[Golang Rewrite Proxy](https://github.com/karmanyaahm/golang-unified-push-rewrite-proxy) is a program can be installed to run as a rewrite proxy for FCM.

Traffic from /FCM on any reverse proxy (for TLS) can be proxied to it. The following is an example for Nginx.

```nginx
location  /FCM {    
        proxy_pass            http://127.0.0.1:5000;
}
```
